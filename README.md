Time Series and Machine Learning Prediction for HPC and Cloud Data Centres 
==========================================================================

This project aim to developed an efficient failure prediction data-driven model using machine learning and conducted an investigation into the trend of the failed components in a high-performance infrastructure.

It also developed a time series model for failure prediction, then test and validate the prediction accuracy of the developed model using data collected for storage, networking and computational machines over a five-year period.
